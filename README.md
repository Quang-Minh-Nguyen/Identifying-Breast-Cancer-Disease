# Identifying-Breast-Cancer-Disease

In this project, I was given the task of building a binary classification model to categorize the patients into Malignant Cancer group or Benign Cancer group. I decided to run both liner ML algorithms and non-linear ML algorithms. To some extent, the work involved feature scaling and imbalance handling with SMOTE. Eventually, the most suitable model was Random Forest Classifier. Besides, I also built a GUI for an user-friendly experience. For more details, please look into the file since I explained very carefully in it.
